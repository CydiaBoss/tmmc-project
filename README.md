# tmmc-project

Team Project for the TMMC Competition

At the Toyota Innovation Challenge 2023 held at the University of Waterloo, the goal was to develop machine learning algorithms using computer vision libraries to identify if a hole was covered by a sticker, not covered by a sticker, or partially covered by a sticker in real time using live feed from a camera.

Below shows live feed of the machine learning vision script running using a camera.
Note that C stands for a hole fully covered by a sticker, NC stands for a hole not covered by a sticker, and PC stands for a hole partially covered by a sticker.
